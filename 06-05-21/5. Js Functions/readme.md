# Creation of Functions

- Create a function that takes two arguments. Both arguments are integers, a and b. Return true if one of them is 10 or if their sum is 10
  * Ex: makesTen(9, 10) ➞ true 
  * makesTen(9, 9) ➞ false, 
  * makesTen(1, 9) ➞ true

- Create a function that takes the number of wins, draws and losses and calculates the number of points a football team has obtained so far.
  * wins get 3 points
  * draws get 1 point
  * losses get 0 points
  *  Ex: footballPoints(3, 4, 2) ➞ 13
